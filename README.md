## jupyter  notebooks / conda / jupyter.sns.gov

- showing one way the users can log in and get access to their notebooks (https://github.com/JeanBilheux/IPTS_16259)
- At the end of the day, those are running scripts found [here](https://github.com/JeanBilheux/IPTS_scripts)

## jupyter widgets

Goal is to simplify user's life and avoir errors 

- Here we look at 2 notebooks that do the same thing but one takes advantages of the widgets, the other don't (https://github.com/JeanBilheux/NotebooksWithWithoutWidgets.git)
- List of widgets and how to use them (https://github.com/JeanBilheux/python_tutorial/tree/master/jupyter/widgets)

## jupyter for training

- video made to show the users how to use the notebooks (https://www.dropbox.com/s/7065w17czkzff5e/JupyterNotebookTutorial.mov?dl=0)

- review of various tools develooped for users:
  1. bragg edge extraction for Gian (https://github.com/ornlneutronimaging/BraggEdge)
  2. notebook for live experiment (https://github.com/ornlneutronimaging/TOFexperiments)
  3. adding files together in parallel (https://github.com/ornlneutronimaging/users_ipython_notebook/blob/master/images_manipulation/combine_images_from_n_folders_parallelization.ipynb)
  4. resonance imaging (https://github.com/JeanBilheux/ResonanceImaging)
  
# Pyqtgraph

- show iBeatles in action (https://github.com/ornlneutronimaging/iBeatles)
- to run pyqtgraph examples

```
  pip install pyqtgraph
  > python
  import pyqtgraph.examples.
  pyqtgraph.examples.run()
  ```

- github that show the ibeatles_light to get up and running in no time (https://github.com/neutrons/GUI_Tools/tree/master/pyqtgraph)
